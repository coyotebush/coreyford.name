![Embarcadero from Pier 14][Embarcadero]

Last week, I wrapped up a summer internship at [Mozilla][], on the Gecko
Rendering (Layout/Graphics) team. I worked out of Mozilla's [San Francisco
office][office map] (visible towards the left of my picture above), a
beautiful space [overlooking the San Francisco Bay][office view].

The Work
---

My main [project][bug] for the summer was implementing CSS [sticky
positioning][] in the [Gecko][] rendering engine, which forms the core of
Firefox. I gave a short [presentation][] on the topic in my second-to-last week
([slides here][slides]):

This turned out to be a great internship project, being

 * **summer-sized:** manageable within 3 months (starting from scratch) but
   complex enough to take most of that time

 * **relatively independent:** not intimately linked to anyone else's summer
   work, so I was able to take the lead myself

 * **useful, but not release-critical:** Gecko developers and web developers
   have been interested in this feature for a while, but there were no solid
   deadlines in anybody's mind

Lessons
---

This was really my first time working on a software development project on the
scale of Firefox, and I certainly learned some things along the way:

 * **There are many ways to solve a problem.** Unlike with carefully
   constructed school assignments. At the same time, one can have a reasonable
   intuition about which approaches are (more or less subjectively) better.
   Several pieces of code I developed went through multiple stages of
   refactoring as I (and my code reviewers) tried to improve on that.

 * **Existing code is not sacred: be bold.** More than once I've been reluctant
   to add a new field to some existing class just to solve my small use case.
   Often that type of structural modification can be the simplest solution, and
   nobody is particularly attached to the details of the existing design.
   However, there is still lots of wisdom in code and people that have been
   around much longer than oneself.

 * **Documentation is often not the best way to understand code.** The Gecko
   codebase actually has fairly good inline documentation, and also plenty of
   wiki pages/blog posts/presentations giving higher-level overviews. Even
   still, I spent quite a lot of time during the first month of my internship
   trying to wrap my head around the machinery that is the 200,000+ lines of C++
   in the `layout` directory. I probably should have bothered people with more
   questions as I went, but it wasn't until a couple weeks in that I could ask
   anything very intelligent. After that point, conceptual questions were
   usually best answered by another person with experience in the relevant code.

People
---

The people I worked/had lunch/chatted with over the course of the summer were
wonderful---committed to [what they do][manifesto] while being incredibly
down-to-earth and friendly. Even though I chose Mozilla in part for the
project's philosophy, this amazing culture exceeded my expectations, and has
set a high bar for my future job searches.  While my [mentor][dbaron] and
several others from my team sat close to my desk in San Francisco, towards the
end of my internship I ended up working more with people based in Mozilla's
Auckland and Toronto offices (via IRC and Bugzilla).

Also, the awesome "intern herding" team did a great job of keeping an eye out
for all the interns, organizing fun events, and really fostering community---I
know I've made some good friends who I'll keep in touch with.

City Life
---

Although I grew up in the Bay Area, I had never spent much time in San Francisco
before this summer. But I knew enough about the housing market to happily accept
Mozilla-sponsored housing within a 10-minute walk (!) to the office.

San Francisco is a friendly and wonderfully quirky city. But I learned that
downtown big-city life is not quite for me. I'm not sure whether it's just the
constant noise and bustle of Market St, or the difficulty of really escaping to
nature (Golden Gate Park doesn't quite cut it), or some combination of those
and more, but the balance shifted from exciting towards stressful as the summer
went on.

**All in all, an excellent way to spend my summer. Thanks to everyone who made
it possible!**
